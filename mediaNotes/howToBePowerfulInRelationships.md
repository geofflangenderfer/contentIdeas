Q: How has suppressing my emotions hurt me?
- when you listen to your emotions they gives hints towards:
  - my needs
  - my boundaries
  - remedying acions
  - stop projecting disowned parts of myself onto others

I miss out on these things if I pretend I don't have emotions  

Q: how can I emotionally self-soothe or validate?

- reveal thoughts, needs, and feelings:
  - how they landed on you
  - what that made you think
  - how that made you feel and why
